# TRAVIARE
### Description:
This is my final project for the cs50x introduction to computer science. Here I have created a complete website called TRAVIARE for travelers who wish to travel to Sri Lanka. From this website, travelers will book luxury accommodations around Sri Lanka and get a tremendous amount of information about Sri Lanka without even being there. That's not all travelers also will be able to buy gadgets that are helpful while traveling. to create this complete website, I have used my knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. as the main feature of this website. Travelers can create their accounts and log in. all the user signup information will be saved in a database to log in whenever they want. This website also contains a unique SVG site map to list all the web pages on this website. A gallery with many pictures and information about images will help travelers get an idea and choose places to travel in Sri Lanka. I have also created the trivia, inspired by a cs50x problem set to give travelers a 10% discount on their first booking from our website only if they have completed the quiz successfully, behalf of all of those cool features, this website or contains a query form section to inform their complication directly through a deleted email. And an about us selection to contact the company to get any required details if needed.
